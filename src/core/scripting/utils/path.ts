/**
 * Case insensitive file systems have descripencies in how they handle some characters (eg. turkish Upper case I with dot on top - \u0130)
 * This function is used in places where we want to make file name as a key on these systems
 * It is possible on mac to be able to refer to file name with I with dot on top as a fileName with its lower case form
 * But on windows we cannot. Windows can have fileName with I with dot on top next to its lower case and they can not each be referred with the lowercase forms
 * Technically we would want this function to be platform sepcific as well but
 * our api has till now only taken caseSensitive as the only input and just for some characters we dont want to update API and ensure all customers use those api
 * We could use upper case and we would still need to deal with the descripencies but
 * we want to continue using lower case since in most cases filenames are lowercasewe and wont need any case changes and avoid having to store another string for the key
 * So for this function purpose, we go ahead and assume character I with dot on top it as case sensitive since its very unlikely to use lower case form of that special character
